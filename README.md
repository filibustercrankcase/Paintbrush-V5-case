# Paintbrush-V5-case
Basic case for the ARTSEY.IO V5 Paintbrush PCB

This is a case designed for the 8 key ThePaintbrush V5 PCB, designed by KemoNine, found here: https://github.com/artseyio/thepaintbrush

This keyboard is designed to be used with the ARTSEY system or style of typing, which you can find more info here: https://artsey.io/

It utilizes M2 x 3.5 x 4 heat inserts to attach the PCB, which I found on AliExpress.
